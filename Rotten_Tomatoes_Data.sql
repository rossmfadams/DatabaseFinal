Subsequently determined to make a name for themselves in the world of cinema, Anthony and Joe got a head start on film-school education by using credit cards and student loans to finance Pieces, a black comedy concerning the hair-replacement industry that served as a crash course into the world of filmmaking for the pair.

His family-friendly sensibilities and keen writing skills have resulted in films that can truly be appreciated by young and old alike -- a true rarity in the realm of so-called 'family entertainment.'A native of Rockport, MA, Stanton received his BFA in character animation from the California Institute of the Arts before working as an animator for Kroyer Films in the 1980s. As the decade drew to a close, Stanton also worked as a writer for animation legend Ralph Bakshi's Mighty Mouse, the New Adventures.

After settling in Oakland, CA, he began performing in high-school plays. He continued acting while attending Cal State, Sacramento, and left to pursue his vocation full-time. In 1978, Hanks went to find work in New York; while there he married actress/producer Samantha Lewes, whom he later divorced.Hanks debuted onscreen in the low-budget slasher movie He Knows You're Alone (1979). Shortly afterward he moved to Los Angeles and landed a co-starring role in the TV sitcom Bosom Buddies; he also worked occasionally in other TV series such as Taxi and Family Ties, as well as in the TV movie Mazes and Monsters. Hanks finally became prominent when he starred opposite Daryl Hannah in the Disney comedy Splash!, which became the sleeper hit of 1984. Audiences were drawn to the lanky, curly headed actor's amiable, laid-back style and keen sense of comic timing. He went on to appear in a string of mostly unsuccessful comedies before starring in Big (1988), in which he gave a delightful performance as a child in a grown man's body.','My Life in Ruins','Notes From The Field');

Vidor took this opportunity to watch the same movies over and over, learning from what he saw and deciding that he could do as good a job as most of the people whose films were up on the screen. After working as an amateur photographer, he began shooting newsreel material of events in his area of Texas and selling it to newsreel producers. It was after his marriage to the former Florence Arto in 1915 that he decided to head out to the then newly formed film colony in Hollywood. The couple entered the motion-picture business, but Florence Vidor was the far more successful of the two at first, starting out as a bit player and moving up to supporting roles in films such as A Tale of Two Cities (1917) and into starring roles in the late teens and 1920s.
